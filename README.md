# Phen2Gene Runner for PhEval
This is the Phen2Gene plugin for PhEval. Highly experimental. Do not use.

## Developers

Warning, the pheval library currently needs to be included as a file reference in the toml file.

```
poetry add /Users/yaseminbridges/Documents/GitHub/pheval

poetry lock

poetry install
```

This will change when pheval is published on pypi.
